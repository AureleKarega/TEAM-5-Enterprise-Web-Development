# Project Description
This project processes MoMo SMS transaction data (XML format), cleans and categorizes it, stores it in a relational database (SQLite), and builds a frontend dashboard to analyze and visualize the data.



It demonstrates skills in:
- Backend data processing (ETL pipeline)
- Database management
- Frontend visualization
- Collaborative development workflows (Agile/Scrum, GitHub Projects)


# System Architecture
The system has three main layers:

1. *ETL Pipeline* – Parses raw MoMo XML → cleans → categorizes → loads into database → exports dashboard JSON  
2. *Database (SQLite)* – Stores structured transactions and categories  
3. *Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)* – Reads processed JSON or API endpoints and displays charts/tables
